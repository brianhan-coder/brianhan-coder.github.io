# Ling Han

## Bio
I'm Ling Han, a first-year PhD student at Yale Computer Science. I received my M.S. in Computer Science from Wuhan University, advised by [Prof. Zongpeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnsBY_AAAAAJ&hl=en）（Tsinghua University), and co-advised by [Prof. Hao Huang](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2467.htm#). I received my bachelor’s degree from Wuhan University, advised by [Prof. Jing Chen](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/info/1272/3389.htm). My research interests include Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, Blockchain and Security. I’m working on the projects related to protein interface and matching prediction with interpretable machine learning, protein structure and properties study with GNN, and Ethereum protocol security. If you’re interested in any of those topics, feel free to email me. I’m always open to schedule a meeting with my fellow researchers on the interesting research and ideas.
