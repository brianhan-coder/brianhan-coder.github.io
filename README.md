## Bio
I'm **Brian**, a.k.a. **Ling Han**, a second-year PhD student at [Yale Computer Science](https://cpsc.yale.edu). I received my M.S. in Computer Science from Wuhan University, advised by [Prof. Zongpeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnsBY_AAAAAJ&hl=en)(Tsinghua University), and co-advised by [Prof. Hao Huang](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2467.htm#). I received my bachelor’s degree from Wuhan University, advised by [Prof. Jing Chen](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/info/1272/3389.htm). My research interests include Machine Learning, Medical Informatics and Privacy. If you’re interested in any of those topics, feel free to email me. I’m always open to schedule a meeting with my fellow researchers on the interesting research and ideas. <br>
